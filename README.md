### Information
**Status:** This project is still in heavy development and is not ready for use.

This project was created so that us Linux users can get some Stream Deck love too!

I purchased my Stream Deck back when the product was first release but have since switched my main OS to Linux.  Sadly Elgato doesn't show the Linux community any love so this is here to try and fix the void that has been left by Elgato.

This project is in no way supported or affliated by/with Elgato.

## Downloading
There currently isn't a version ready for download at this time.

You will also need to have Chrome installed on your machine.  This requirement is due to the UI using the [Lorca](https://github.com/zserge/lorca) library.  This is more lightweight than something like Electron because it doesn't bundle Chrome into the app itself, but reuses the one that is already installed on your machine.
